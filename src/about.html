              Having had my thespian aspirations quashed at an impressionable age by my inability to land a speaking part 
              in the primary school production of The Wizard of Oz, and being instead saddled with the role of an uncoordinated 
              leggings wearing “whirlwind dancer” prancing around (upstage) to Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygene; I found solace when 
              my design was chosen for the play program. 
              </b>
              Since then design has continued to redeeme and define me. My liaison with design was consummated with a formal 
              education, first with an art and design foundation at Camberwell College of arts then a design degree from Goldsmiths 
              University of London. My Front-End Web Development Course is from General Assembly. 
              </b>
              Away from design I can be found drinking craft beers in the most pretentious way possible or indulging in my other 
              love, film. Enough about me, what's your story?
