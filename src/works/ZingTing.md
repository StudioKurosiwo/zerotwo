                  Working in conjunction with German interactive design expert Stefan Hermann, Zing Ting was a one day instructor-led hands-on workshop for designers,artists and anyone else who wanted to learn how to create physical interaction devices using the arduino microcontroller in the framework  of Fritzing.

                <p>Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists, researchers and hobbyists to work creatively with interactive electronics. Fritzing streamlines the design process, making it easier to get from design to prototype to production. Zing Ting was part of London Design Festival 2010, The festival seeks to celebrate and promote London as the design capital of the world.</p>
